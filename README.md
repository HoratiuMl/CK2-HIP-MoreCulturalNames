# Installation

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- This mod requires up-to-date HIP with at least the SWMH module installed.
- Backwards-compatibility with older HIP versions is intended but not guaranteed.
- Also, this mod officially supports HIP with only the default modules installed, but it should work with any setup as long as SWMH is there.

- When manually updating, please remove all the previous files of this mod.

# Development focus

Currently, the development focuses on the following areas:

- Landed title names for your native language (you can start with neighbouring countries)
- Minor titles and jobs localisations

# Development guidelines

- Encode files with the `WINDOWS-1252` character set
- Make sure the names you add are historically accurate for the medieval era
- Do not override names already provided by HIP, unless there is a good reason to do so
- Check with the original HIP files and take note of the already existing names (especially for similar cultures) and the name displayed ingame (which might be very different from the internal name in the files, e.g. `d_galich` is Halych ingame)
- Make sure there are no other dependencies than the default HIP modules. Do not add names for optional modules or other submods.

Additional guidelines and rules can be found in header comments inside specific files.
