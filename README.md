# Installation

Just subscribe to the [Steam Workshop page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1175098675) of this mod.

If you don't own this game on Steam, or you want to try the in-development version, you can download the latest release from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/hmlendea/ck2-hip-more-cultural-names/releases) and extract the contents into your "mod" directory alongside your current HIP installation.

**Note:** This mod is OS-agnostic, which means it will work on all operating systems supported by CK2 and HIP (Windows, Linux and Mac)

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- This mod requires up-to-date HIP with at least the SWMH module installed.
- Backwards-compatibility with older HIP versions is intended but not guaranteed.
- Also, this mod officially supports HIP with only the default modules installed, but it should work with any setup as long as SWMH is there.

**UPDATING THE MOD:**
- This mod gets updated very frequently.
- Instead on making versioned releases, I decided to make a single "rolling release", so check regularly for changes (the date especially).
You can see the changes in the changelog.
- It's also always recommended to delete the old files when updating a mod (any mod).

# Development focus

Currently, the development focuses on the following areas:

- Landed title names for your native language (you can start with neighbouring countries)
- Missing HIP names for counties and baronies that both have the same name but only one (usually the county) has culture-specific names associated
- Minor titles and jobs localisations

# Development guidelines

- Encode files with the `WINDOWS-1252` character set
- Make sure the names you add are historically accurate for the medieval era
- Do not override names already provided by HIP, unless there is a good reason to do so
- Check with the original HIP files and take note of the already existing names (especially for similar cultures) and the name displayed ingame (which might be very different from the internal name in the files, e.g. `d_galich` is Halych ingame)
- Make sure there are no other dependencies than the default HIP modules. Do not add names for optional modules or other submods.

Additional guidelines and rules can be found in header comments inside specific files
